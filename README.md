# Week 5: GUI Development with JavaFX

## Overview
This week's focus is on developing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using JavaFX. The tasks involve are: 
1. Setting up a basic JavaFX application,
2. Creating a simple calculator, and
3. Building an inventory management application incorporating CRUD operations.


### Task 1: Set Up a Basic JavaFX Application
- Initialized a JavaFX project.
- Created a simple UI layout.
- Explored various GUI components such as buttons, labels, text fields, and layouts.
- Ensured the application runs successfully.

### Task 2: Develop a Simple Calculator
- Designed a JavaFX-based calculator interface.
- Implemented basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
- Used event handling to process user inputs.
- Ensured proper error handling for invalid inputs.

### Task 3: Build an Inventory Management Application
- Designed a UI to manage inventory items.
- Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Used JavaFX controls such as TableView, TextField, and Buttons.
- Ensured data persistence using a file or database.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Recommended: JDK 21 or later).
- JavaFX SDK configured.
- An IDE that supports JavaFX (such as Eclipse).

## Installation and Setup
1. Install Java and JavaFX.
2. Configure JavaFX in your IDE.
3. Clone this repository or create a new JavaFX project.
4. Run the JavaFX application to test the setup.

## How to Run the Applications
1. Compile and run the JavaFX project using an IDE or command line.
2. Follow UI interactions to explore functionalities.
3. For the calculator, enter numbers and select operations to perform calculations.
4. For inventory management, add, update, and remove items as required.
